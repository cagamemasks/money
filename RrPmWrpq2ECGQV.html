                                 <strong>TACTICS OF BOLLINGER BANDS</strong><p><span> </span></p><p><span>In Forex trading, there are many trading indicators that are trusted by traders. The tactics of Bollinger bands belong to this category - powerful analytical tools that can significantly simplify forecasting and reduce risks in the process conclusion of trade transactions. In fact, Bollinger bands are based on the action of two forces that have a significant impact on chart changes - indicators of the main axis of the price range of the current trend and changes in indicators (compression/expansion) during the movement of price values. It is based on the interaction of these factors these two factors create patterns on the charts that line up when bars pass through the set boundaries. </span></p><h3><span><b>We recommend brokers to trade on Forex:</b></span></h3><ul><li><span></span><a><b>ALPARI</b></a></li><li><span></span><a><b>ROBOFOREX</b></a></li><li><span></span><a><b>Forex4You</b></a></li><li><span></span><a><b>AMarkets</b></a></li><li><span></span><a><b>InstaForex</b></a></li></ul><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span> </span></figcaption></figure><p><span>The Bollinger bands are three lines designed for the most accurate determination of extremes price values for the current time period and are the most effective short-term indicators within the framework of technical Analytics tools. Accordingly, the upper and lower bands determine the oversold/overbought boundaries of the traded asset and the price movement within them can be fairly reliable indicate the current state of the market situation at a specific time.Â </span></p><p><span>The tactics of Bollinger bands allow us to effectively use them in active interaction with other indicators, in particular, with Japanese candlesticks, which allow us to predict market changes in the near future. The effectiveness of Bollinger bands as indicators is due to the speed of their reaction to changes in price indicators. The wave-like curves of the figures of this indicator allow you to predict the range of movements of the trend with a high degree of probability, but only if the trader has sufficient experience of interpretation values of such graphical constructions.</span></p><p><span>Experience with Bollinger bands is especially important when the price band is compressed . in this case, you can expect a stop in the trend movement, while the strength of the impact of band compression on the price can be different and calculate exactly how large the impact will be. delicate. But the effort to master the tactics of Bollinger bands is worth it - it is this indicator that makes it possible to determine the presence of implicit price fluctuations as accurately as possible and allows you to establish a positive trend towards profit within the framework of making a deal.</span></p><p><span>But it is worth remembering about this feature of the application tactics of Bollinger bands, such as higher accuracy in determining time indicators, faster accuracy in determining price parameters. Fluctuations in the bands can be limited by a small distance from the local maximum or minimum values, and even produce a pullback of positions, which presages the proximity of a new one the momentum of the current trend. But stopping the movement of lanes, as a rule, can be noticed in the case of a decrease in its indicators in the growing lane or growth in the falling one. And the appearance of side bars is possible both in a market with a clearly expressed trend, and in a calm state of it. At the same time, price values are very often not able to reach a new level of minimum or maximum until there is a graphical expansion of the bands, which means that there are opportunities for free movement of the price.</span></p><p><span>When choosing the tactics of Bollinger bands, it is very important for a trader to track chart changes. In particular, there are significant differences in aspiration the upper borders of the bands and other indicators usually serve as a signal for a possible breakout, the moment of which, as a rule, falls on the price reaching the level of the band's base. It is also important to track the level of slope of the bands when bars reach / approach the levels of reaching the price minimum/maximum. It is this data that serves the basis for calculating the necessary time period and applying forces that will allow you to capture the moment favorable for a breakout at the price of the achieved resistance/support barrier.Â </span></p><p><span>The most effective use of the Bollinger bands tactic is achieved by tracking the change indicators real-time charts. It is with this indicator that you can most reliably re-test indicators of minimum/maximum price levels that currently require verification. The Bollinger bands are also useful in early forecasting of a trend change. A noticeable change in the the speed of movement of price indicators is recorded on the chart by a significant increase in the width of the bands, followed by their narrowing when market activity changes. It is the combination of these factors that can serve as a preemptive signal for the trader, allowing him to determine the moment of trend change with a fairly high accuracy, marked by rapid and short market movement in vertical dynamics.</span></p><p><span>You can reduce trading risks when using Bollinger bands by reducing the time scales and waiting for the moment of reversal necessary to enter a position opposite to the current trend. In addition, it effectively reduces the risk level using not only bar indicators, but also other forms of resistance/support as evaluation criteria. In this case, the trader has the opportunity to make an additional check of the level of entry into the market. You should also pay attention to the parameters of price rollbacks. If it does not leave the limits of the lanes, and there is no other reason assuming a reversal trend, it is possible to predict with a high degree of probability a return to the movement in the direction of the trend, timely forecasting of which can give a good profit.Â </span></p><p><span>In the process of trading with the use of Bollinger bands as indicators, it is worth using this type of reduction option risk management is defined as the simultaneous use of three different time scales for plotting charts. It is this tactic that allows you to notice emerging market changes in a timely manner, which are not displayed on the main chart. At the same time, the take profit and stop loss limit levels should be set based on the following criteria indicators of the main schedule, based on which the trade is conducted.Â </span></p><p><span>Of course, experienced traders working within the framework of the tactics of Bollinger bands are well aware of how effective the simplest version of applying this indicator is, in which the signal to buy becomes a breakout borders of the lower band in the area of oversold market. Of course, the breakdown immediately provokes an increase in market activity and in most cases a quick correction and further return of price indicators to the trend with subsequent growth. It is important not to forget about such an integral component as setting the stop-loss level, which will help you cope with the situation if it develops according to a negative scenario. It is this kind of reasonable risk management, coupled with correctly selected indicators and other analytical tools, that always brings tactical success in Forex trading.</span></p><div></div>
