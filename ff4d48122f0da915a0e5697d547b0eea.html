                                 <strong>How to save, save and invest money</strong><p><span> </span></p><p><span>Some economic ideologues seriously claim that saving is pointless, and call thrift the philosophy of losers. According to them, saving money for a rainy day means programming yourself for misery, spending time searching for inexpensive ones products and services-to sink into total dissatisfaction. </span><span><b>Pavel Golubev, PhD in Economics and an employee of a financial company</b></span><span>, does not agree with this approach. He believes that business is interested in the cult of consumption, in a careless attitude to money, and the government and even the UN stand in solidarity with him! All they want people to live one day and spend money quickly.</span></p><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span></span></figcaption></figure><p><span>Therefore, options based on conservative spending, saving and investing are no longer in Vogue. People have no choice but to rely on their own sanity, to think about the future. take responsibility for your loved ones and try to plan for the future.</span></p><p><span>Pavel Golubev suggests considering three main aspects of personal Finance in this context: spending, saving and investing.</span></p><h2><span><b>Expenditure</b></span></h2><p><span>You need to spend it. A conservative approach to spending does not mean austerity and rejection of the benefits of civilization. However, it is important to understand that we live in an era of overstocking, when supply outstrips demand, and manufacturers are forced to fight for every buyer. According to Market Watch research, most people living in developed countries buy products at prices higher than the regional average. It is interesting that in developing countries, including Russia, even more people overpay for goods â€” 64%. It turns out that we don't want to look for places where we can buy products that interest us cheaply or at least at an average price.</span></p><p><span>The consumer basket of an ordinary Russian includes no more than 300-400 goods/services. If if you allocate time and find more favorable offers for 100-200 positions, you can save 10-20% of the family budget on a monthly basis.</span></p><p><span>This effect is achieved solely by selecting more attractive pricing options. We are not talking about changing tastes and preferences, you will not have to change your favorite brands, buy products of lower quality. The contents of the refrigerator and clothing cabinets will not change, but you will be able to save a decent amount of money. In addition, when people consume goods at an undervalued price, they contribute to reducing </span><span><u>inflation </u></span><span>and increasing competition between producers.</span></p><p><span>Of course, there will be very busy wealthy citizens for whom time is money and the search for optimal price options for the sake </span><span><u>of saving </u></span><span>10-20% is not acceptable. However, in the era of the Internet and trade virtualization, most goods, if not sold Online, are at least represented there. Why not use it this?</span></p><h2><span><b>Accumulation</b></span></h2><p><span>According to VTSIOM, only 24% of Russians save at least some part of their income. It is not just low wages that play a role here, but people's attitude to money. Any household will not develop if at least 5% of income does not go into the stash. With savings you can not be afraid force majeure, it is easier to improve the quality of life of the family.</span></p><p><span>There is no income that cannot be saved. Many people cannot save because of psychological reasons and lack of technical skill. Even if you have a salary of 10 thousand per month, and all the money goes out, without lingering in the wallet, you can also meet the same 9 thousands per month, having previously set aside 10% of income. Although people with such a salary should first try to solve the issue of filling the family budget, and then think about saving.</span></p><p><span>As for psychological difficulties, there is no single universal recipe, although there are various technical solutions receptions. For example, immediately after payday, you can convert some of your funds into a currency. This approach will not only reduce the likelihood of wasting the deferred portion of income, but also invest it in an asset more reliable than the ruble. If the willpower is weak, and the currency is sure to be converted back into rubles, then you can start a new one </span><span><u>a savings account </u></span><span>that you can't withdraw money from prematurely and automatically transfer a small portion of your income to it.</span></p><p><span>There is also a more radical method of saving â€“ the purchase of desired goods on credit. Accumulation of this option can only be called a stretch, but it allows you to solve the problem of insufficient funds for a large purchase: for example, for a car or apartment. Once you have signed a loan agreement, you will be required to pay a certain amount every month. That is, Willy-nilly, you will have to save money, only they will be taken by the Bank, and you will be able to immediately use your purchase. However, it is important to understand that such a banking service has its own price, so it is desirable to take a loan only if we are talking about an investment object (housing, land) or a tool for earning money (a vehicle, commercial real estate, equipment).</span></p><p><span>Accumulation has not only a positive material value it has a positive effect on a person's peace of mind. People who can boast of a solid </span><span><u>" airbagÂ» </u></span><span>they feel more confident, sleep better, and are not afraid to change jobs.</span></p><h2><span><b>Investment</b></span></h2><p><span>Today, many people are trying to earn money by investing, often speculating on this topic. Thousands of companies are looking for wealthy people, offering to invest both in real financial instruments and in dubious projects. The promised returns and periods of enrichment sometimes look so attractive that people forget about the risks. They are tempted by bright examples of enrichment, however only one side of the coin is shown in the form of a round sum, and the base at the expense of which the result was achieved is omitted. In fact, the lion's share of successful investments is the fruit of high professionalism or exceptional luck.</span></p><p><span>Saving is very difficult, but spending is easy â€“ this is the devil of personal Finance. To to get a stable income with the help of tools available to the population, you need to learn this for at least a few months. </span><span><u>The stock market</u></span><span>, </span><span><u>Mutual </u></span><span>funds , </span><span><u>bonds</u></span><span>, </span><span><u>investments in metals </u></span><span>â€“ all this works, but for some it is a plus, and for others it is a minus. Things happen, a person in the first month on the stock market increases investments by 100-200% (if very lucky), but in the second month the results are more modest, and the third brings only losses. Proper investments do not provide a one-time profit, but a stable income. To be successful in the financial market, you will have to study dozens of books. This the thorny path will not pass without several months of practice and numerous mistakes, for which you will have to pay out of pocket.</span></p><p><span>For Russians, the best investment option is currency. Any strong currency: dollar, Euro, pound or yen. But what about the strengthening of the ruble? After all, in recent months, there are situations that a person buys, for example, ,000, and a week later they give 50 kopecks less for a dollar, and this results in a loss of 5,000 rubles. Skeptics should look at the dynamics of currency quotes over the past 10-25 years. During this time, the ruble has weakened significantly against the dollar. The longer the period you consider, the clearer this pattern will become. No one invests for a week or a month, feel free to invest and calmly wait for the next peak of the ruble.</span></p><div></div>
